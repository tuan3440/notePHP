Common layout instructions:

<block>
Blocks are a foundational building unit for layouts in Magento. They are the link between a PHP block class (which contains logic) and a template (which renders content). Blocks can have children and grandchildren (and so on). Information can be passed from layout XML files to blocks using the <arguments/> child node.

Attribute:
+class : Name of a class that implements rendering of a particular block. An object of this class is responsible for actual rendering of block output.
+display :Prevents a block from displaying (the associated PHP classes are still loaded).have 2 value:true/false
+name : Name that can be used to address the block to which this attribute is assigned. The name must be unique per generated page.

+before	Dash (-)	The block displays before all other elements in its parent node.
+before	[element name]	The block displays before the named element.
+before	Empty value or [element name] is absent	Use the value of after. If that value is empty or absent as well, the element is considered as non-positioned.
+after	Dash (-)	The block displays after all other elements in its parent node.
+after	[element name]	The block displays after the named element.
+after	Empty value or [element name] is absent	Use the value of before. If that value is empty or absent as well, the block is considered as non-positioned.

+as : An alias name that serves as identifier in the scope of the parent element.

+template : A template that represents the functionality of the block to which this attribute is assigned.Vendor_Module::path/to/template.phtml (Scope is already in the templates directory of the module)

+cacheable :Defines whether a block element is cacheable. This can be used for development purposes and to make needed elements of the page dynamic.true or false. Defaults to true.

+ifconfig: Makes the blockâ€™s visibility dependent on a system configuration field.XPath to the system configuration field. E.g. contact/contact/enabled


*container:
A structure without content that holds other layout elements such as blocks and containers.

Details: A container renders child elements during view output generation. It can be empty or it can contain an arbitrary set of <container> and <block> elements. If the <container> is empty, and there is no child <block> available, it will not be displayed in the frontend source code.


+name	A name that can be used to address the container in which this attribute is assigned. The name must be unique per generated page. If not specified, it will be autogenerated.	A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore (_), period (.), dash (-). Should start with a letter. Case-sensitive.

+label	Describes the purpose of the container.	Any

+before	Dash (-)	The block displays before all other elements in its parent node.
+before	[element name]	The block displays before the named element.
+before	Empty value or [element name] is absent	Use the value of after. If that value is empty or absent as well, the element is considered as non-positioned.
+after	Dash (-)	The block displays after all other elements in its parent node.
+after	[element name]	The block displays after the named element.
+after	Empty value or [element name] is absent	Use the value of before. If that value is empty or absent as well, the block is considered as non-positioned.

+ as	An alias name that serves as identifier in the scope of the parent element.	0-9, A-Z, a-z, underscore (_), period (.), dash (-). Case-sensitive.


+output : Defines whether to output the root element. If specified, the element will be added to output list. (If not specified, the parent element is responsible for rendering its children.Any value except the obsolete toHtml. Recommended value is 1.
+htmlTag : Output parameter. If specified, the output is wrapped into specified HTML tag.Any of the following: aside, dd, div, dl, fieldset, main, nav, header, footer, ol, p, section, table, tfoot, ul

+htmlId:Output parameter. If specified, the value is added to the wrapper element. If there is no wrapper element, this attribute has no effect.Any valid HTML 5 id value.

+htmlClass : Output parameter. If specified, the value is added to the wrapper element. If there is no wrapper element, this attribute has no effect.Any valid HTML 5 class value.


*action: The <action> instruction is deprecated. If the method implementation allows, use the <argument> for <block> or <referenceBlock> to access the block public API.
Calls public methods on the block API.

Details: Used to set up the execution of a certain method of the block during block generation; the <action> node must be located in the scope of the <block> node.
<action> child nodes are translated into block method arguments. Child nodes names are arbitrary. If there are two or more nodes with the same name under <action>, they are passed as one array.
